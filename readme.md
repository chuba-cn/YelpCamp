2. MongoDB (Community Edition preferably) to store data. Instructions on downloading and installing MongoDB on your computer can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
3. Create a [cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free) to get an API key, cloudname and secret.

  ```
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
  CLOUDINARY_KEY='<your_cloudinary_api_key>'
  CLOUDINARY_SECRET='<your_cloudinary_api_secret>'
  DB_URL='<your_mongodb_url>'
  ```

4. Once installation is complete, run `npm start` on the same terminal and run `mongosh` on another terminal to start your mongodb database server.
5. Open your web browser and visit the address <http://localhost:3000> and voila!
